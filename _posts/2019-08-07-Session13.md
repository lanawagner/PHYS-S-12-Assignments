### My Final Project: a Gesture Controlled Car

**My final project is a car that uses gestures from a glove as input for a control system. It is able to drive around and do different movements depending on how you flex or extend your hand.**

This was my initial idea; it honestly has not changed much, except for my input method for the glove. ![sketch]()
My original goal was to get the car to drive around the lab being controlled by motions of my hand, and I am now able to do that.

I've worked on making many prototypes of the glove and car and sensor inputs. I went from a vinyl glove that would get tangled and messed up to a custom glove I fabricated that is specifically fit for my needs in this project. ![glove glow up]()
My car has grown from a press-fit design with two badly made motor-powered wheels and two free spinning LEGO wheels to a chassis I designed in Fusion that integrates my electronics perfectly, and a custom arm for a ball caster wheel I made myself. ![car glow up]()
My electronics and my skills for making them have improved immensely over these past seven weeks. It started from just a simple magnetic sensor with an analog read function on a breadboard, and now my two Arduinos are able to talk to each other and all the electronic components are on protoboards I soldered. ![electronics glow up]()

I'm really proud of all the work I've done on this final project and on other assignments for PHYS-S-12, please feel free to look at the rest of my documentation to get a more in-depth look into my process!
