### 7/17/19 -- Introduction to 3D Printing and Making a Mini Tea Set!

Today was the first lab in 3D printing week, and we were instructed to create a beginner print that takes around 15 min to complete.

I decided to create a teacup, so using the _[Fusion lampshade tutorial](https://youtu.be/3PnKBSOulwo?list=PLmA_xUT-8UlL23teEbhgeU4-3FE8pprpK)_ as my starting point, I sketched the silhouette of a cup which I revolved completely around the center axis. ![Sketch](teacup_silhouette.png) Then, I sketched the handle and revolved that 10ยบ around the center. After that, I filletted the edges and exported it to Cura for slicing with high refinement. ![Teacup angles](teacup_top.png) ![Teacup angles](teacup_under.png) I used the "fine" setting (0.1mm layer height), and that brought the print time to ~19 minutes. ![Teacup cura](teacup_cura.png) I printed the cup on the Ultimaker 2+, which was easy to configure and operate, and it printed the cup pretty smoothly! ![Print in progress](teacup_progress.png) After the teacup cooled, I took it off the print bed and filed down the imperfections and edges. ![Teacup](teacup_printed.png)

Then, using a similar technique to the teacup for the body, I made a matching teapot. ![Teapot sketch](teapot_sketch.png) I used the "sweep" function with help from _[this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5DZGlHD3ng)_ for the spout. I drew a path for the curvature of the spout on my base sketch, and then drew a circle tangent to the base. I extruded the circle using the sweep function along the path, and it created a nice spout. I then filleted the edges, made a few aesthetic improvements, and then exported to Cura. ![Teapot model](teapot_side.png) For this one, I used the "normal" setting to shorten the print time, and it still turned out well, albeit a bit messy. ![Cura slicing](teapot_cura.png) ![On the printer](teapot_ult.png) I had to clean up the sides and the spout a bit, but it still looked great in the end. I also made a matching lid and printed that.

I printed a second teacup to match the first, except I accidentally printed it with supports, so I had to solder out the supports in the handle. I soldered the plastic on a low heat setting, and it removed the excess very easily. I also soldered the edges to clean it up a bit more.

Here's my completed tea set!! I'm very proud. ![Full set](full_set.png) ![Full set 2](full_set_top.png)
