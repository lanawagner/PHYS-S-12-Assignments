### 7/3/19 -- Laser Cutting and Vinyl Cutting

Today during our lab, we were instructed to make a press-fit construction kit from laser cut shapes that interlock together. I decided on using a triangle for my base piece in the construction kit because there are many 3-D modular solids that are solely constructed from triangles.

I wanted to make a triangle that wasn't basic, so I modified the triangle by curving the sides. This was my first attempt of designing the triangle in fusion: ![First attempt](curvy_cad.png) However, I then realized that I had put the slots for connecting the triangles together in the wrong place-- they shouldn't be on the vertices, but instead on the edges. I then adjusted my design accordingly: ![Final design](curvy_cad_real.png)

Next, I decided that I wanted to make an icosahedron, a 20-sided solid figure, out of my triangle faces. ![Icosahedron](ico.png) I wanted the triangle faces to be held in place solidly, so I designed a connector for the faces that would hold the triangles in a proper angle. I used this [list of dihedral angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_polyhedron_dihedral_angles) and the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron) for the icosahedron to get my measurements. The dihedral angle between each face is **138.19ยบ**, so that is what I used for my connector: ![Icosahedon connector](ico_cad.png) 

I came into class the next day with my files ready for cutting, but I hadn't properly accounted for the kerf. After cutting a test round of 2 triangles and a connector, I measured the kerf, and it was 4mm total. I then adjusted my design accordingly to account for the kerf, and the pieces then fir together well. In total, I ended up needing 20 triangles and 30 connectors. When my pieces were ready for cutting, I copy and pasted an array of these shapes within the laser cutter software, and it cut pretty well.

Then I assembled the icosahedron, and it turned out perfectly! I'm very happy. ![Final icosahedron](final_ico.png)

I then wanted to try vinyl cutting to make a sticker. From an explanation of the vinyl cutter by Professor Hart, I learned that the vinyl cutter uses a rotating knife to trace vectors of an image to cut it out. I wanted to make a sticker of the character Miffy, so I first found a simple image for the vinyl cutter software to interpret. ![Original miffy](miffy.png) Then, after inputting it into the vinyl cutter software, these were the interpretations of the image: ![Image constraints](miffy_vector.png) I loaded the vinyl cutter with green vinyl by lifting up the back lever and then moving the wheels to the edge of the material. ![Loaded vinyl cutter](vc_loaded.png)

My stickers ended up being super accurate to the original image and looked amazing! Now they have a permanent home on my laptop. ![Miffy stickers!!!!!!!!](miffy_stickers.png) ![On my laptop](miffy_laptop.png)

I really enjoyed working with both the laser cutter and the vinyl cutter, and am excited to do more in the upcoming sessions!
