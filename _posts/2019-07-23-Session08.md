### 7/24/19 -- Composites and Switching to a Nano

Today, we made a CNC-milled foam mold and layered pieces of burlap with epoxy to make a bowl!

I was working with Tony, and after vetoing the idea to make a tapeworm, we decided on a hexagonal-shaped bowl. We modeled it in fusion by extruding a hexagon, filletting the top edges, and then filletting the sides. ![Model](hexagon_model.png)

When we got to class, we imported our model into the V-carve software, and made a rough cut path and then two smoothing paths. ![V-carve](vcarve.png)
Then, the mill started to cut the foam!
