### 7/8/19 -- First Prototype of the Driving Robot

Today during the lab I wanted to use my newly learned laser-cutting and electronics skills to make a rudimentary prototype of the car part of my final project. My idea is to have the car part consist of a few separate parts: a breadboard holder, two angular wire management panels, and two side panels to mount the motors and wheels onto. These parts will be held together by similar press-fit techniques with angular connectors. The whole shape will look like an upside-down U, with wheels and motors on the side and wires running underneath from the top of the chassis to the motors. Tonight (7/7), I was mocking up the design of some of the pieces I plan to cut tomorrow, so I used this [resource I found](https://www.adafruit.com/product/239) to get a general idea of the dimensions of the breadboard. I  want to check the measurements with a caliper tomorrow, though. I also need to choose the right type of motor and wheels, and measure those dimensions so I can accurately create mounts for them.

A first attempt for the breadboard panel made in fusion, need to fix dimensions: ![Breadboard panel attempt](breadboard_panel_v1.png)


For my circuits, I plan to use an Arduino Nano that can be plugged into my breadboard, and motors that can be powered directly from the Arduino (and if necessary, I can switch to an UNO). I will thread wires through the sides of my chassis to connect to the motors. After the lab tomorrow and when I get the mechanical parts done, I will try to code the Arduino on my own so the car can drive via pre-programmed code.

Game plan for tomorrow:
1. Measure dimensions of the breadboard, pick motors/wheels and measure. Adjust design accordingly.
2. Laser cut the pieces I need to assemble the car.
3. Assemble, use hot glue/other glue to keep pieces together.
4. Wire up a circuit connecting 4 motors/wheels to breadboard/Arduino. Solder if needed.
5. Code the Arduino so when it's turned on the robot can drive.
