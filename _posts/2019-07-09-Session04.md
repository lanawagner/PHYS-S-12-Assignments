### 7/8/19 -- First Prototype of the Driving Robot

**7/7/19: Planning**

During tomorrow's lab I want to use my newly learned laser-cutting and electronics skills to make a rudimentary prototype of the car part of my final project. My idea is to have the car part consist of a few separate parts: a breadboard holder, two angular wire management panels, and two side panels to mount the motors and wheels onto. These parts will be held together by similar press-fit techniques with angular connectors. The whole shape will look like an upside-down U, with wheels and motors on the side and wires running underneath from the top of the chassis to the motors. Tonight (7/7), I was mocking up the design of some of the pieces I plan to cut tomorrow, so I used this _[resource I found](https://www.adafruit.com/product/239)_ to get a general idea of the dimensions of the breadboard. I  want to check the measurements with a caliper tomorrow, though. I also need to choose the right type of motor and wheels, and measure those dimensions so I can accurately create mounts for them.

A first attempt for the breadboard panel made in fusion, need to fix dimensions: ![Breadboard panel attempt](breadboard_panel_v1.png)


For my circuits, I plan to use an Arduino Nano that can be plugged into my breadboard, and motors that can be powered directly from the Arduino (and if necessary, I can switch to an UNO). I will thread wires through the sides of my chassis to connect to the motors. After the lab tomorrow and when I get the mechanical parts done, I will try to code the Arduino on my own so the car can drive via pre-programmed code.

Game plan for tomorrow:
1. Measure dimensions of the breadboard, pick motors/wheels and measure. Adjust design accordingly.
2. Laser cut the pieces I need to assemble the car.
3. Assemble, use hot glue/other glue to keep pieces together.
4. Wire up a circuit connecting 4 motors/wheels to breadboard/Arduino. Solder if needed.
5. Code the Arduino so when it's turned on the robot can drive.

**7/8/19: Building the Prototype**

Today, I made great progress on my actual prototype! When we first got into the lab, we had a micro-lecture on transistors and motor circuits, which was actually very helpful for what I wanted to accomplish today. To wire up a motor circuit that we can switch on and off through code, we need to use a transistor, which is just a fancy switch controlled by the amount of voltage you give through a "gate". Here are some helpful diagrams from class: ![Transistor diagram](transistor_diagram.png) ![Motor circuit diagram](motor_cir_diagram.png)

Next, I used the information that we learned about motor circuits to build my circuit for my prototype. Instead of connecting four motors to four wheels, I decided to use two motors connected to two wheels and then have two free-spinning wheels in the front of the robot. In my circuit, I first hooked up the two transistors, using the _[datasheet](http://www.vishay.com/docs/91308/sihld24.pdf)_ for the part to know which pin was which. ![Transistors in the circuit](transistor_circuit.png) I picked out two geared DC motors to wire up because as we learned, the gearing gives the motor more torque, which is better for driving. There were 4 holes on the surface of the motor for mounting, so I also found proper screws to use later. ![Motors and screws](motors_screws.png) I had to solder the wires onto the motors first before completing my circuit. ![Soldering motors](motors_solder.png) Here's my final circuit: ![Final circuit](final_circuit.png)

After wiring my circuit, I moved towards working on my laser-cut pieces for the chassis. I first measured the breadboard with a caliper to find the proper dimensions, and my original guess was actually pretty accurate. I then laser-cut the test base for the breadboard I had designed last night. ![Laser cutter view](laser_cut_array.png) The spots for the connectors were slightly too far in (they interefered with the breadboard), so I adjusted my design and cut it again. In the end, my breadboard base ended up being two centimeters wider than I had originally designed, but with the guard rails I also cut, it holds the breadboard securely. ![Breadboard panel final](breadboard_panel_f.png)

I then worked on making mounts for the motors I chose earlier. I first designed a test version to mount one motor before incorporating the hole pattern into the actual side panels. ![Screenshot of test mount](motor_mount_test.png) First, I took measurements with a caliper of the diameter of the motor, the center-aligned holes and their distances from the edge, and the width of the motor shaft so it could fit through. Here are the measurements I took: ![Measurements](mount_measurements.png) The test worked out very well, and the screws and shaft fit perfectly! ![Motor mount and motor](motor_w_mount) ![Screwed in mount](screwed_mount.png)

Next, I had to find the proper wheels to use for my chassis. I looked in the LEGOÂ® bin because I couldn't find any other wheels, and I found two small, rubber wheels, some axles, and some axle collars to use to make my free spinning wheels. I also found two shaft collars in the bearings bin to put the axles through. ![Parts for free-spinning wheels](free_spin_parts.png) This is how it turned out-- the wheels spin pretty nicely! ![Wheels mounted](mounted_free_spin.png) Now, I need to find proper wheels I can mount onto the motors (or even make my own wheels) next time.

I finished cutting out all the parts for the chassis in the laser-cutter, and I hot glued the edges together for stability. I added in slots for wire management. One problem I noticed, though, is that cardboard is very flimsy and is a wobbly material, so my next prototype needs to be much more robust and stable. I mounted in the motors, as well. Here is the final product of all I got to assemble and do today: ![Mounted motors](p_mounted_motor.png) ![Top view](p_top_view.png) ![Side view](p_side_view.png)
