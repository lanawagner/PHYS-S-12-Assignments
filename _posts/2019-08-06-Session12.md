### 6/27/19 -- Final Project Idea

**For my final project, I want to make a wearable control system controlled by hand motions to drive around a small robot.**

The wearable control system will be a glove-like apparatus. It will have certain circuits or sensors within the glove so that when the user's hand flexes or relaxes, the glove will have a completed circuit or give a sensor value that will translate into a motion for the driving robot. Different fingers flexed would translate to turning or stopping. The completion of these circuits would then be translated into movement commands sent over serial communication to a small robot. ![Closed circuit](sketch_side_closed.png) ![Open circuit](sketch_side_open.png)

The glove would ultimately be made of a softer material, maybe cast/molded, and have circuits and electronics smoothly embedded in it. It would have the main Arduino/circuitboard on the back of the hand. It would also have LEDs that would indicate when certain circuits/sensors have the proper readings to move. ![Glove top view](sketch_top.png)

The robot being controlled would be a small, simple robot. It would either have a 3 or 4 wheel drive, and would likely be made out of CNC milled material or a 3D printed chassis. The electronics would be easily accessible. ![Robot top and side view](sketch_robot.png)

My eventual goal with this final project is to get the small robot to drive around the lab being controlled by motions of my hand.
