### 6/27/19 -- Final Project Idea

**For my final project, I want to make a wearable control system controlled by hand motions to drive around a small robot.**

The wearable control system will be a glove-like apparatus. It will have certain circuits or sensors within the glove so that when the user's hand flexes or relaxes, the glove will have a completed circuit or give a sensor value that will translate into a motion for the driving robot. Different fingers flexed would translate to turning or stopping. The completion of these circuits would then be translated into movement commands sent over serial communication to a small robot. ![Closed circuit](sketch_side_closed.png) ![Open circuit](sketch_side_open.png)

The glove would ultimately be made of a softer material, maybe cast/molded, and have circuits and electronics smoothly embedded in it. It would have the main Arduino/circuitboard on the back of the hand. It would also have LEDs that would indicate when certain circuits/sensors have the proper readings to move. ![Glove top view](sketch_top.png)

The robot being controlled would be a small, simple robot. It would either have a 3 or 4 wheel drive, and would likely be made out of CNC milled material or a 3D printed chassis. The electronics would be easily accessible. ![Robot top and side view](sketch_robot.png)

My eventual goal with this final project is to get the small robot to drive around the lab being controlled by motions of my hand.

### 7/2/19 -- How I'm going to approach the project

I think I first want to tackle the small, controlled robot, and then work on sensors and serial communication for the glove. Since we're learning laser-cutting in the next few days, I want to make a press-fit chassis for my robot with space to mount motors and an arduino. I also want to attach wheels onto the motors and get the robot to drive around using pre-programmed the Arduino code.

In the following few weeks, I plan to shift my focus to the glove part. I need to learn more about sensors to decide on which to use for the glove, and I also need to figure out how the glove will communicate with the robot. I would also like to make the chassis for the robot out of a much sturdier material.

### 7/8/19 -- First prototype of the driving car part

You can check the _[documentation for this lab](http://lanawagner.github.io/PHYS-S-12-Assignments/04/)_ for a much more in-depth explanation of the prototype and how I made it, but here is a summary of what I accomplished.

- I made a simple chassis for the car
- I hooked up a working circuit with two DC motors that move in the right direction
- I wrote code that consists of a modifiable, time-based series of pre-programmed movement functions.

This prototype was pretty successful because it functioned how I intended it too. However, while building it, I noticed some problems/inefficient methods I could fix in later prototypes.

Things to fix:
1. Make it more precise
2. A more structured/robust chassis (a different material?)
3. Add places within the chassis for the breadboard/5V battery/wires
4. Better wheels
5. Faster movement?

Next features/steps:
1. Add in sensors?
2. Move away from breadboard (to a custom, smaller circuit)?
3. Fix the chassis so it's made of 1 piece.
4. Start working on/developing glove, learn about sensors/electronics needed there.
5. Start working on communication between glove and car.

### 7/15/19 -- An approach to the glove

For our weekly assignment, we had to use a button to control LEDs and other output devices, so I used this as an opportunity to devise an initial prototype of the glove. I used a few small strips of the adhesive copper sheets, soldered on wires and resistors, and used an extra scrap of copper to act as the actual "pressing" part, so when I put the copper down on the two leads, the LED would turn on. I improved on this mechanism, first starting out with having the copper strips on a sheet of cardboard, and then transitioning it onto a latex glove. Eventually, instead of just turning on an LED, I used the "button pressing" to drive a motor. Here was my final circuit: ![Final circuit](glove_proto_1_wired.png)

One problem I had, though, was that the latex glove was too flimsy and the copper kept on bending the glove when I didn't want it to, so for later prototypes I will have to likely use a fabric glove of some sort. Also, it was pretty hard to accurately get the copper lead on my finger to connect the two on my palm. In the future to solve these problems, I want to make the control via bending more accurate, and not rely on connecting two leads together. I might use sensors, either capacitors or magnetic sensor, to detect the distance between my finger and palm, getting a more specific reading.

### 7/22/19 -- The glove, but improved!

This week, we were working on using input devices (sensors) to get readings of conditions, and I used this as an opportunity to test out sensors with my glove. I used the Hall Sensor (which senses magnetic field) and a magnet as a distance sensor. When I bring the magnet closer to the sensor, it changes the reading to be closer to 5V or 0V, depending on the side. I tried to first implement these changes on a vinyl glove, but hot glue wasn't sticking. I found some new materials (webbing and expandable tubing) in the sewing cabinet, and the hot glue stuck much better. I also lasercut a box to hold the UNO. I like this version of the glove a lot better, now that it's in multiple parts, because it's much more robust. I think I'll be sticking with this general new structure of multiple bands or rings rather than a solid glove. However, the UNO is really bulky, so I'm planning on switching to an Arduino Nano or ProMini for my final version. I also want a way to keep the ring attached to the band and to mount a power source to the band, but I'll find that later. ![Top](glove_proto_2_top_view.png) ![Under](glove_proto_2_palm_view.png)
