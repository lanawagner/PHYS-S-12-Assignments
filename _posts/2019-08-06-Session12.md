### 6/27/19 -- Final Project Idea

For my final project, I want to incorporate new fabrication techniques that I have little to no prior experience with electronics to make a project that I can use and further develop after the summer.

A good post describes what you did to complete the assignment, including text and images and links to any 3rd party resources you used. A great post serves as a tutorial that is detailed enough that someone else could recreate your assignment just from your documentation. 

Other Markdown syntax you may want to use: 

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

<!-- You can include comments that will not be translated to HTML -->

<!-- You can include links and images in the following format: -->

[Link Description](url) and ![Alternative text](motor.jpg)


<!-- Or, you can also directly include HTML, for example to make a split image -->

<img src="board1.jpg" alt="Board Traces" style="height: 200px; max-width: 48%">
<img src="board2.jpg" alt="Board Interior" style="height: 200px; max-width: 48%">


<!-- You can also use HTML tags to include a video -->
<video width="955" height="541" controls>
	<source src="demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<!-- Or to add a download link to any (reasonably small) file in your permalink directory -->

<a href='cube.stl' download>Click to download my STL file</a>
