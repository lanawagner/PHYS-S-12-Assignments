Hi, I'm Lana Wagner. I'm a rising junior from New York City, and this summer I'm in the Harvard Summer School Program and I am taking PHYS-S-12, Introduction to Digital Fabrication.

I am part of my school's robotics team, and there I have taken a strong interest in digital fabrication, especially 3D printing, laser cutting, and casting. Outside of robotics in school, I have worked on a few robotics projects of my own - a small robot controlled by a GUI in Processing, and most recently, a robotic arm that can draw controlled by an iOS app. I am currently working on serial communication between the robotic arm app and the arm itself to have full control and motion from the app.

This summer I want to expand and improve my fabrication skills, especially with electronics and other machines I am less familiar with. I want to use this course as an opportunity to immerse myself in an environment I'm so interested in and passionate about, and to make a project that I can develop more and use after this summer.
